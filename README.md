# 🖥️ MultiThreaded Web Server

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **single-threaded**, **multi-threaded**, and **thread pool–based** web servers in Java.  
It shows how server-side concurrency works and how multiple clients can connect to a server simultaneously using Java’s `Socket`, `ServerSocket`, `Thread`, and `ExecutorService` APIs.

## ⚙️ Features
- 🧩 **SingleThreaded Server** — handles one client at a time  
- ⚡ **MultiThreaded Server** — creates a new thread for each client  
- 🧵 **ThreadPool Server** — uses a fixed pool of threads for better resource management  
- 💬 Simple **Client** programs for each server type  
- 🔄 Demonstrates **socket communication**, **concurrency**, and **I/O handling** in Java
